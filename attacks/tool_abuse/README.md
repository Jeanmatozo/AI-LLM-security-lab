# Tool Abuse Scenarios

This directory contains adversarial scenarios designed to test whether
LLM-based agents can be coerced into misusing legitimate tools.

Tool abuse differs from prompt injection in that:
- the tool itself is authorized
- the misuse comes from manipulated intent or parameters

Scenarios here focus on confused-deputy risks, indirect coercion,
and privilege boundary testing.
