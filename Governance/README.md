# Governance Artifacts

This directory translates technical attack findings into
enterprise governance, risk, and compliance language.

While the rest of the repository focuses on:
- how systems break,
- how attackers abuse them,
- and how controls fail,

This folder focuses on:
- how leaders understand the risk,
- how organizations govern it,
- and how controls are justified.

## How This Fits the Lab

This separation mirrors real organizations:

- Red Team: breaks the system  
- AppSec: fixes the system  
- GRC: governs the risk  

This folder represents the **GRC layer** of the lab.
