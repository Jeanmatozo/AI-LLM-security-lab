# AI & LLM Security Lab

My personal lab to explore cybersecurity for AI systems — with a focus on:
- Prompt injection and jailbreaks
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) security
- LLM agents and tool abuse
- Mapping AI risks back to ISO/IEC 27001-style controls

## Who I am

I am an ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Lead Auditor and cybersecurity learner transitioning into
a role as a **Cybersecurity engineer / penetration tester focused on AI & LLM security**.

## Lab Roadmap (First 10 Weeks)

1. Create this repo and basic structure (src/, attacks/, reports/, notes/)
2. Build a simple LLM chatbot
3. Run and document prompt injection experiments
4. Build a small RAG app over local documents
5. Test indirect prompt injection from malicious documents
6. Build a basic agent with tool access (files / dummy API)
7. Simulate tool abuse and data exfiltration scenarios
8. Implement mitigations and guardrails
9. Document threat models and risks
10. Map AI risks to ISO/IEC 27001-style controls
